				  <h1>Threads, Processes, and Concurrency</h1>
				  <p class="lead">A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process is an active entity that is provided, supported, and managed by the operating system with the purpose of providing an enviornment to execute a program. Concurrency is the tendency for things to happen at the same time in a system.
				  In order for an operating system to support concurrency, it must provide multiple threads of control. A process can be in 3 states:
				  <ul>
					<li>Blocked - waiting for the system to give it some input or gain control of some resource</li>
					<li>Ready - waiting for the system to give the process its turn to execute</li>
					<li>Running - a process that is currently using the CPU</li>
				  </ul>
				  Multitasking is a concept that allows a system to manager multiple processes which each have multiple threads, however a single thread of control is executing at once among all the processors.
				  This provides the illusion of concurrency. Multiprocessing however, is a concept that allows a system to manager multiple processors which allows for true concurrent execution.

				  <h1>Locks, Mutexes, Semaphores, and Monitors</h1>
				  <p class="lead">A lock occurs when a single thread requires a resource and does not want to share the resource until the thread completes. A Mutex is a mutual exclusion object that can be locked by threads
				  so that the threads can take turns utilizing the mutex. A mutex is locked by a thread until that thread unlocks the mutex. A Semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used to control access to
				  a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system. An example of this is a semaphore would be used to split a 4kb buffer into 4, 1kb buffers for 4 different processes to utilize concurrently. Monitors 
				  are used to achieve process synchronization. A montior is a collection of variables and procedures that are combined together. Processes running outside the monitor cannot access internal variables but can call
				  monitor procedures. Finally, only 1 process can execute code inside a monitor at a time. Two operations that can be performed on the condition variables of a monitor are "wait" which blocks the process and 
				  "signal" which runs a blocked process on the blocked queue for that condition variable.

				  <h1>Scheduling and Context Switching</h1>
				  <p class="lead">Scheduling is concept of selecting which processes to execute in which order. Algorithms for scheduling processes include simple queues, a round robin system, a priority system, and more.
				  An example is windows where each thread is given a priority while each process scheduling class is also given a priority. Context Switching is the procedure of storing the state of an active process for the CPU
				  when it has to start executing a new process. Context Switching is easy between threads and requires more overhead between processes which require more overhead.

				  <h1>Deadlocks, Livelocks, and Starvation</h1>
				  <p class="lead">
				  <ul>
					  <li>Deadlocks - When 2 or more processes cannot procede because they are both waiting for the other to give them a resource or release a lock. Difficult to detect beforehand due to the halting problem.</li>	
					  <li>Livelocks - When processes are consistently changing state while doing no work. This usually occurs when the processes are trying to allow another process to do work in order to avoid a deadlock.</li>
					  <li>Starvation - Starvation occurs when a thread is never allowed to process due to greedy threads with higher priority before it.</li>
